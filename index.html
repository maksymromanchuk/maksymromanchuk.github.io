Never Summer’s new Proto Type Two model is an asymmetric blend of their popular Proto HD board, mixed with elements of their Funslinger and Ripsaw models. This new combination had our testers saying, “Damn. I’m impressed,” “Great all-mountain board with tons of stability and lots of power!” and “This is one of the best Never Summers I’ve ever tested.” The board’s softer flex and freestyle leaning make it a go-to for riders looking for a forgiving and playful board that can rip around the whole mountain. One tester suggested the Proto II is best for “intermediates looking to step up and advanced riders who want a playful all-mountain slayer.” It’s backed by high-tech ingredients like carbon fiber “Vs” in the tips and “Xs” underfoot for loads of stability and pop, something our testers noticed immediately saying, “This board has a really comfortable flex that’s nice and buttery through ollies, edge-to-edge transitions, edge hold, and more. Lots of ollie power!” The Proto II comes packed with the lightest wood core that Never Summer makes and has multiple layers of dampening material to smooth out the ride. It feels featherweight in your hands, and you can count on its twin asymmetric shape to balance out your riding.</p>

<p>(Flex is not standardized and differs by brand. The rating here is the best estimate of<br />
the board’s flex.)</p>
<p>(Sidecut Radius: If you arced the tightest turn possible to make a complete circle, the sidecut radius would be the distance between the direct center of that circle and its rim, in meters. A board with a deeper sidecut would have a smaller radius and would generally make tighter turns. As the radius number increases, a board can be expected to make wider turns. Multiple numbers on the same length board means the radius is blended.)</p>
